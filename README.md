# IBM-PS2-Model-70-HDD-Power-adapter

This pcb can be inserted into the ESDI drive connector on the IBM PS/2 model 70 riser card (very few ESDI drives still function, if I understand correctly). This allows an amphenol (molex) connector to be attached to a hard drive replacement and draw power from the +5v and +12v lines provided on the ESDI connector. I have found this useful when running either a SCSI hard drive (or emulator) or an IDE hard drive (or equivalent) in my model 70. I have tried to make the traces reasonably beefy to allow for the current, but no guarantees :)  I would advise using a lower-wattage storage device if possible, though I have run standard spindle 3.5 SCSI drives in my unit without incident.
